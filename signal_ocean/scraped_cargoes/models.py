class ScrapedCargo:
    """Detailed information about a scraped cargo.

    Attributes:
        cargo_id: Integer. A unique identifier of the cargo line.
        message_id: Integer. A unique identifier of the message containing the
            specific cargo. A message can contain more than one cargo.
        external_message_id: String. It serves as a unique identifier for a
            message, supplied by any company that has integrated with Signal.
        parsed_part_id: Integer. A unique identifier for each email part. The
            email body and each attachment are considered different parsed
            parts. For an example the email body and its pdf attachment have
            same MessageID and different ParsedPartID.
        line_from: Nullable integer. The starting line from which the cargo is
            extracted. The email subject counts as line 0 and the body content
            starts from line 1.
        line_to: Nullable integer. The final line from which the cargo is
            extracted. For single line cargoes LineFrom is equal to LineTo.
            For descriptive cargoes that span across multiple lines we have
            LineTo>LineFrom. These two numbers help the user identify which
            part of the text has been used to extract the cargo data.
        in_line_order: Nullable integer. This integer is used to list different
            cargoes extracted from the same line. It is the case for cargoes
            with different discharge options. A cargo with a discharge and
            an option like 'med-ukc' is interpreted in our system as 2 cargoes
            with same MessageID, same ParsedPartID, same LineNumber,  different
            CargoID and an incremental InLineOrder number.
        source: String. It describes the source of the information. Our system
            allows the user to inject data in many different ways, namely
            through email (Source='Email'), through Slack channels
            (Source='Slack') or through manual contributions directly from our
            frontend platform TSOP (Source='User').
        updated_date: String, format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, UTC timezone. Date on
            which the cargo has been reevaluated for the last time. In case of
            an email received by a broker one month ago and reprocessed through
            our engine today, this date will be today's.
        received_date: String, format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, UTC timezone. Date
            on which the cargo has been injected into our system and processed.
        is_deleted: Boolean. This value is true if the cargo is marked as
            Deleted.
        scraped_laycan: String. The laycan (latest day of cancellation) of the
            cargo as reported in the original text. It if often reported as a
            date range, e.g. '25-jan 27-jan', '31-1 feb', '11-12 apr'. The
            string 'dnr' (date not reported) can also be found.
        laycan_from: Date, format YYYY-MM-DD. The mapped date corresponding to
            the beginning of the laycan date range.
        laycan_to: Date, format YYYY-MM-DD. The mapped date corresponding to
            the end of the laycan date range.
        scraped_load: String. The loading location reported in the original
            text of the cargo. It is very often shortened, very compact and can
            refer to terminals, ports, countries or wider areas. Examples:
            'singgi' for Singgi, 'rt' for Ras Tanura, 'waf' for West Africa.
        load_geo_id: Integer. It is the internal ID of the mapped loading
            location reported in the cargo. Our models convert and map a
            scraped string containing geo information to a specific entity of
            the Signal's proprietary geofencing structure. Each geo entity is
            identified by a taxonomy, an ID and a name. Examples: the string
            'bonny' is mapped to a geo asset with name 'Bonny', ID 3679 and
            taxonomy Port (TaxonomyID=2); the string 'nigeria' is mapped to a
            geoasset with name 'Nigeria', ID 171 and taxonomy Country
            (TaxonomyID=3); the string 'wafr' is mapped to a geoasset with name
            'Africa Atlantic Coast', ID 24772 and taxonomy Level0
            (TaxonomyID=4).
        load_name: String. The name of the Signal geo entity related to the
            reported loading location of the cargo. Examples: 'Bonny',
            'Nigeria', 'Africa Atlantic Coast', 'Arabian Gulf', 'Singapore',
            'East Coast Mexico'.
        load_taxonomy_id: Integer. An internal ID corresponding to each
            taxonomy, the level of geo details, from 1 to 7. A terminal
            (geoasset) has the lowest taxonomy (TaxonomyID=1), a port has
            TaxonomyID=2, while countries and wider areas have higher taxonomy
            (TaxonomyID>=3). Examples of Level 0 areas (TaxonomyID=4) include
            'Arabian Gulf', 'US Gulf' and 'East Mediterranean'. Level 1 areas
            (TaxonomyID=5) consist of multiple level 0 areas (TaxonomyID=4).
            For example, level 1 area 'Mediterranean' groups together the
            level 0 areas 'West Mediterranean', 'Central Mediterranean' and
            'East Mediterranean'. Level 2 areas (TaxonomyID=6) consist of
            multiple level 1 areas (TaxonomyID=4). For example, level 2 area
            'Mediterranean/UK Continent' groups together the 'Mediterranean'
            and 'UK Continent' level 1 areas. Level 3 areas (TaxonomyID=7) are
            the highest area grouping in our taxonomy and consist of multiple
            level 2 areas (TaxonomyID=6). Examples of such areas are
            'Pacific America' or 'Africa'. These group together level 2 areas.
            For instance, 'Pacific America' groups together the level 2 areas
            'West Coast North America', 'West Coast Mexico',
            'West Coast Central America' and 'West Coast South America'.
        load_taxonomy: String. The extended name identifying the TaxonomyID.
            Possible values are: GeoAsset-> 1, Port -> 2, Country-> 3,
            Level0->4, Level1->5, Level2->6, Level3->7.
        scraped_load2: String. The second loading location reported in the
            original text of the cargo. It is very often shortened, very
            compact and can refer to terminals, ports, countries or wider
            areas. Examples: 'singgi' for Singgi, 'rt' for Ras Tanura, 'waf'
            for West Africa.
        load_geo_id2: Integer. An internal ID corresponding to the mapped

            original text of the cargo. It is very often shortened, very
            compact and can refer to terminals, ports, countries or wider
            areas. For cargoes reporting multiple discharge options, this field
            contains only the first string. For example in the cargo
            'mercuria 75 ulsd n. mangalore ukc-wafr-jpn 14/jan

            reporting voyage charter and time charter agreements. Possible
            values are 0 and 1.
        charter_type: String. The extended name of the type of shipping
            contract reported in the cargo. Values currently supported are
            'Voyage'->0, 'Time charter'->1.
        cargo_status_id: Numeric ID corresponding to the different values of
            the CargoStatus field. 0-> OnSubs, 1-> FullyFixed, 2 -> Failed,
            3 ->Cancelled , 4-> Available, -2 -> NotSet, -1 -> Unknown.
        cargo_status: String denoting the commercial status of a cargo if
            explicitly mentioned, like 'ffxd' for fully fixed or 'subs'/'-s-'
            for on subs.
        content: String. The full content of the cargo. For a single line cargo
            it is the line content. For multi line cargoes it is the collection
            of all the relevant parts of the text.
        subject: String. The email subject of the cargo. This field has content
            when Source="Email".
        sender: String. Our own mapping of the shipping company sending out the
            market report through email. This string helps grouping emails sent
            by the same organization, but from different domains. It is often
            the case for big organizations operating worldwide. For example
            Sender= 'SSY' for both domains 'ssysin.com' and 'ssy.co'.
        is_private: Boolean. A cargo is private if injected by a user into his
            own private account within TSOP. A user can provide private
            information through email forwarding, through manual contributions
            or through Slack. Private cargo information stay in the account,
            are accessible by the account users only (people within the same
            company) and are the most valuable ones.
