class ScrapedPosition:
    """Detailed information about a scraped position.

    Attributes:
        position_id: Integer. A unique identifier of the position line.
        message_id: Integer. A unique identifier of the message containing the
            specific position. A message can contain more than one positions.
        external_message_id: String. It serves as a unique identifier for a
            message, supplied by any company that has integrated with Signal.
        parsed_part_id: Integer. A unique identifier for each email part. The
            email body and each attachment are considered different parsed
            parts. For an example the email body and its pdf attachment have
            same MessageID and different ParsedPartID.
        line_from: Nullable integer. The starting line from which the position
            is extracted. The email subject counts as  line 0 and the body
            content starts from line 1.
        line_to: Nullable integer. The final line from which the position is
            extracted. For single line positions LineFrom is equal to LineTo.
            For descriptive positions that span across multiple lines we have
            LineTo>LineFrom. These two numbers help the user identify which
            part of the text has been used to extract the position data.
        source: String. It describes the source of the information. Our system
            allows the user to inject data in many different ways, namely
            through email (Source='Email'), through Slack channels
            (Source='Slack') or through manual contributions directly from our
            frontend platform TSOP (Source='User').
        updated_date: String, format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, UTC timezone. Date on
            which the position has been reevaluated for the last time. In case
            of an email received by a broker one month ago and reprocessed
            through our engine today, this date will be today's.
        received_date: String, format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, UTC timezone. Date
            on which the position has been injected into our system and
            processed.
        is_deleted: Boolean. This value is true if the position is marked as
            Deleted.
        scraped_vessel_name: String. The vessel name as reported in the
            position line, i.e. 'Signal Alpha', 'Cpt A Stellatos',
            'Genco Tiberius'. 'TBN' can also be found.
        scraped_deadweight: String. The dead weight of the vessel as
            reported in the position line, i.e. '150249', '167'.
        scraped_year_built: String. The year built of the vessel as reported in
            the position line, i.e. '2004', '09'.
        imo: Integer. The seven-digits number that uniquely identifies the ship
            reported in the position. It is the result of our internally
            developed Vessel Mapper model.
        vessel_name: String. It is the current vessel name corresponding to the
            IMO mentioned above. Provided to better specify the vessel and its
            particulars. Source: our internal Vessel Database.
        deadweight: Integer. The dead weight in tonnes [t] corresponding to the
            IMO mentioned above.
        year_built: Integer, YYYY format. The year the vessel was built.
            Source: our internal Vessel Database.
        liquid_capacity: Integer, measured in cbm [cbm]. The liquid capacity of
            the IMO mentioned above. Source: our internal Vessel Database.
        vessel_type_id: Integer. Numeric ID corresponding to the different
            values of the VesselType field. 1-> Tanker, 3-> Dry,
            4 -> Containers, 5 ->LNG (Liquified Natural gas),
            6-> LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas).
        vessel_type: String. Description of the type of the vessel
            (VesselTypeID), based on the carried cargo. Main categories are
            Tankers, Dry (bulk carriers), Containers, LNG and LPG.
        vessel_class_id: Integer. It is an ID corresponding to the different
            vessel classes of a certain vessel type, as split according to our
            internal Vessel Database. For example 84->VLCC, 85->Suezmax,
            70->Capesize.
        vessel_class: String. Name of the vessel class the vessel belongs to.
            Assignment of a vessel to a certain VesselClass is based on the
            VesselType and the value of its Deadweight (if Tanker or Dry), its
            LiquidCap (if LNG/LPG) or its TEU (if Containers). For example, an
            Aframax is a Tanker vessel with Deadweight within the range
            82kt - 125kt, while a Capesize is a Dry vessel with Deadweight
            within the range 120kt-220kt. LR2 are defined as Aframax, as only
            Deadweight is used to define vessel classes.
        scraped_open_date: String. The open date of the position as reported in
            the original text. It is often reported as a date range, e.g.
            '13/16 April'.
        open_date_from: Date, format YYYY-MM-DD. The mapped date corresponding
            to the beginning of the open date range.
        open_date_to: Date, format YYYY-MM-DD. The mapped date corresponding to
            the end of the open date range.
        scraped_open_port: String. The open location reported in the original
            text of the position. It is very often shortened, very compact and
            can refer to terminals, ports, countries or wider areas. Examples:
            'singgi' for Singgi, 'rt' for Ras Tanura, 'waf' for West Africa.
        open_geo_id: Integer. It is the internal ID of the mapped open location
            reported in the position. Our models convert and map a scraped
            string containing geo information to a specific entity of the
            Signal's proprietary geofencing structure. Each geo entity is
            identified by a taxonomy, an ID and a name. Examples: the string
            'bonny' is mapped to a geo asset with name 'Bonny', ID 3679 and
            taxonomy Port (TaxonomyID=2); the string 'nigeria' is mapped to a
            geoasset with name 'Nigeria', ID 171 and taxonomy Country
            (TaxonomyID=3); the string 'wafr' is mapped to a geoasset with name
            'Africa Atlantic Coast', ID 24772 and taxonomy Level0
            (TaxonomyID=4).
        open_name: String. The name of the Signal geo entity related to the
            reported open location of the position.Examples: 'Bonny',
            'Nigeria', 'Africa Atlantic Coast', 'Arabian Gulf', 'Singapore',
            'East Coast Mexico'.
        open_taxonomy_id: Integer. An internal ID corresponding to each
            taxonomy, the level of geo details, from 1 to 7. A terminal
            (geoasset) has the lowest taxonomy (TaxonomyID=1), a port has
            TaxonomyID=2, while countries and wider areas have higher taxonomy
            (TaxonomyID>=3). Examples of Level 0 areas (TaxonomyID=4) include
            'Arabian Gulf', 'US Gulf' and 'East Mediterranean'. Level 1 areas
            (TaxonomyID=5) consist of multiple level 0 areas (TaxonomyID=4).
            For example, level 1 area 'Mediterranean' groups together the
            level 0 areas 'West Mediterranean', 'Central Mediterranean' and
            'East Mediterranean'. Level 2 areas (TaxonomyID=6) consist of
            multiple level 1 areas (TaxonomyID=4). For example, level 2 area
            'Mediterranean/UK Continent' groups together the 'Mediterranean'
            and 'UK Continent' level 1 areas. Level 3 areas (TaxonomyID=7) are
            the highest area grouping in our taxonomy and consist of multiple
            level 2 areas (TaxonomyID=6). Examples of such areas are
            'Pacific America' or 'Africa'. These group together level 2 areas.
            For instance, 'Pacific America' groups together the level 2 areas
            'West Coast North America', 'West Coast Mexico',
            'West Coast Central America' and 'West Coast South America'.
        open_taxonomy: String. The extended name identifying the TaxonomyID.
            Possible values are: GeoAsset-> 1, Port -> 2, Country-> 3,
            Level0->4, Level1->5, Level2->6, Level3->7.
        scraped_commercial_operator: String. The position commercial operator
            as reported in the original text. Examples: 'aet', 'thenamaris',
            'bpcl'
        commercial_operator_id: Integer. Numeric ID corresponding to the
            commercial operator company that it is reported in the line. We use
            an internal mapper to find the correspondence between the reported
            string and our database.
        commercial_operator: String. The company name corresponding to the
            CommercialOperator field. Provided to better specify the company
            involved in the business. Source: our internal Company Database.
        scraped_cargo_type: String. The position cargo type as reported in the
            original text, often shortened. Examples: 'nhc', 'ulsd', 'ums',
            'nap', 'go'.
        cargo_type_id: Integer. It is an internal ID corresponding to the
            mapped cargo type of the position. A proprietary model is
            responsible to match the reported cargo type string to a specific
            cargo type in our hierarchy. Examples: 19-> Crude Oil, 16->Fueloil,
            9-> Naphtha, 135-> Unleaded Motor Spirit, 12-> Gasoil,
            60-> 'Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel (ULSD 10ppm)'.
        cargo_type: String. The extended name corresponding to the CargoTypeID
            field. Source: our internal CargoTypes database.
        cargo_type_group_id: Integer. Numeric ID corresponding to the
            high-level cargo type of the position cargo type. It is provided to
            group positions and facilitate analytics. Examples: 130000->Dirty,
            120000-> Clean, 110000->IMO.
        cargo_type_group: String. The extended name corresponding to the
            CargoGroupID field. Source: our internal CargoTypes database.
        scraped_last_cargo_types: String. The position last cargo types as
            reported in the original text. Examples: 'ums/palm/go',

        last_cargo_types_ids: List of Lists. Contains the internal ID [Id] and
            TaxonomyID [TId] corresponding to the mapped cargo types report
            within last cargo types on position. Each list represents the cargo
            types of each voyage and contains dicts with [Id] and [TId] for
            every cargo type of the voyage. For example for
            ScrapedLastCargoTypes field that contains 'ums/ulsd/jet+nap'
            corresponding LastCargoTypesIDs field contains
            '[[{'Id': 135, 'TId': 0}], [{'Id': 60, 'TId': 0}],
                [{'Id': 14, 'TId': 1}, {'Id': 9, 'TId': 1}]]'
            First voyage: ScrapedLastCargoTypes='ums' corresponds to
                LastCargoTypesIDs=[{'Id': 135, 'TId': 0}]
            Second voyage: ScrapedLastCargoTypes='ulsd' corresponds to
                LastCargoTypesIDs=[{'Id': 60, 'TId': 0}]
            Third voyage: ScrapedLastCargoTypes='jet+nap' corresponds
                to LastCargoTypesIDs=[{'Id': 14, 'TId': 1},
                {'Id': 9, 'TId': 1}]]
        last_cargo_types: String. The extended names corresponding to each
            CargoTypeID on LastCargoTypeIDs. Voyages are separated with '/'.
            Cargo Types within same voyage are separated with '+'.
            Example:
            ScrapedLastCargoTypes='ums/ulsd/jet+nap'
            LastCargoTypesIDs=[[{'Id': 135, 'TId': 0}], [{'Id': 60, 'TId': 0}],
                [{'Id': 14, 'TId': 1}, {'Id': 9, 'TId': 1}]]
            LastCargoTypes='Unleaded Motor Spirit / Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel
                (ULSD 10ppm) / Jet + Naphtha'

            content when Source="Email".
        sender: String. Our own mapping of the shipping company sending out the
            market report through email. This string helps grouping emails sent
            by the same organization, but from different domains. It is often
            the case for big organizations operating worldwide. For example
            Sender= 'SSY' for both domains 'ssysin.com' and 'ssy.co'.
        is_private: Boolean. A position is private if injected by a user into
            his own private account within TSOP. A user can provide private

            position information stay in the account, are accessible by the
            account users only (people within the same company) and are the
            most valuable ones.
