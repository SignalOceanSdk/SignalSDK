    Attributes:
        id: String. Uniquely identifies the event detail.
        event_id: String. Uniquely identifies the event that this event detail
            relates to.
        event_detail_type: String, denotes the type of the event detail. For
            instance, "StS" indicates that the event is a ship-to-ship
            operation, while "Jetty" describes that the event took place in a
            jetty.
        arrival_date: Date, format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. The beginning of the
            specific event. The arrival date of an event is calculated based on
            the first AIS point within the event. In the case of missing AIS
            data, the arrival date is derived based on the last reported
            location of the vessel before the event and the time without
            reported AIS information.
        sailing_date: Date, format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. The end of the specific
            event. The sailing date of an event is calculated based on the last
            AIS point within the event. In the case of missing AIS data, the
            sailing date is derived based on the next reported location of the
            vessel after the event and the time without reported AIS
            information.
        start_time_of_operation: Date, format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. Timestamp
            indicating the beginning of the operation described by the event

            ship operation.
        end_time_of_operation: Date, format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. Timestamp
            indicating the end of the operation described by the event detail.
            This is the timestamp of the final AIS point the vessel is tracked
            within a jetty or that is captured performing a ship-to-ship
            operation.
        sts_id: String, A unique identifier assigned to each ship-to-ship
            event. Will be identical for both participating vessels.
        geo_asset_id: Numeric ID corresponding to the geo asset in which the
            event took place. Geo assets represent maritime facilities such as
            terminals, anchorages and lightering zones. Multiple geo assets are
            grouped under the same port.
        geo_asset_name: Name of the GeoAsset in which the event took place. Geo
            assets represent maritime facilities such as terminals, anchorages
            and lightering zones. Multiple geo assets are grouped under the
            same port.
        latitude: Numeric, decimal value representing the latitude of the
            location where the event took place. The location of the vessel is
            identified from AIS data within the duration of the event or, in
            the case of missing AIS data, from the location of the GeoAsset in
            which the event took place. If the event represents an operation in
            a jetty or a STS operation, the latitude reports the location of
            the first AIS within the jetty or STS operation.
        longitude: Numeric, decimal value representing the longitude of the
            location where the event took place. The location of the vessel is
            identified from AIS data within the duration of the event or, in
            the case of missing AIS data, from the location of the GeoAsset in
            which the event took place. If the event represents an operation in
            a jetty or a STS operation, the longitude reports the location of
            the first AIS within the jetty or STS operation.

            denotes the total carrying capacity of the vessel including cargo,
            ballast water, stores, provisions, crew and so on.
        commercial_operator_id: Numeric ID corresponding to the maritime
            company that manages the vessel commercially.
        deleted: Boolean. This will be true if the voyage has been deleted from

        events: The events that took place during the voyage.
        id: String. Uniquely identifies the voyage.
        horizon_id: Numeric ID that takes the following values Unknown (0),
            Historic (1), Historical (1), Current (2), Future (3)
        horizon: String. It can take "Historic", "Current" or "Future" values,

            EndDate in the future) or future (both StartDate and EndDate in the
            future). Note: the notions of "past", "current" and "future" are
            not derived by the current date, but by the comparison between the
            voyage dates and the latest received AIS for that specific vessel.
        latest_received_ais: Date, format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. The most recent
            AIS update for the vessel. It is used to define the horizon of a

            VesselType and the value of its Deadweight (if Tanker or Dry), its
            LiquidCap (if LNG/LPG) or its TEU (if Containers).   For example,
            an Aframax is a Tanker vessel with Deadweight within the range 82kt
            - 125kt, while a Capesize is a Dry vessel with Deadweight within
            the range 120kt-220kt. LR2 are defined as Aframax, as only
            Deadweight is used to define vessel classes.
        trade: Additional attribute used to specify a Tanker vessel with finer
            granularity. It is derived by the last cargo carried by the vessel
            at the time of query.  For example, an LR2 with fueloil as last
            cargo has VesselClass=Aframax and Trade=Product.
        trade_id: For Tankers only. Numeric ID that takes the following values
            1 -> Crude, 2 -> Product, 3 -> Chemical.

            vessel commercially.
        start_date: Date, format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. The beginning of the

            previous voyage (if existing) or the first received AIS (for a new
            building). Voyages are consecutive and with no breaks in between,
            therefore a vessel is always in a voyage.
        first_load_arrival_date: Date, format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. The time
            of arrival for the first load in the voyage. Indicates the

                    received AIS (for a new building). Voyages are
                    consecutive and with no breaks in between, therefore a
