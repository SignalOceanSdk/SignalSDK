class ScrapedLineup:
    """Detailed information about a scraped lineup.

    Attributes:
        lineup_id: Integer. A unique identifier of the lineup line.
        message_id: Integer. A unique identifier of the message containing the
            specific lineup. A message can contain more than one lineup.
        external_message_id: String. It serves as a unique identifier for a
            message, supplied by any company that has integrated with Signal.
        parsed_part_id: Integer. A unique identifier for each email part. The
            email body and each attachment are considered different parsed
            parts. For an example the email body and its pdf attachment have
            same MessageID and different ParsedPartID.
        line_from: Nullable integer. The starting line from which the lineup
            is extracted. The email subject counts as line 0 and the body
            content starts from line 1.
        line_to: Nullable integer. The final line from which the lineup is
            extracted. For single line lineups LineFrom is equal to LineTo.
            For descriptive lineups that span across multiple lines we have
            LineTo>LineFrom. These two numbers help the user identify which
            part of the text has been used to extract the lineup data.
        in_line_order: Nullable integer. This integer is used to list different
            cargoes extracted from the same line. It is the case for lineups
            with multiple cargoes or buyers. A lineup with two cargoes like
            'gasoil + fuel oil' is interpreted in our system as 2 lineups with
            same MessageID, same ParsedPartID, same LineNumber,  same IMO,
            different LineupID and an incremental InLineOrder number.
        source: String. It describes the source of the information. Our system
            allows the user to inject data in many different ways, namely
            through email (Source='Email'), through Slack channels
            (Source='Slack') or through manual contributions directly from
            our frontend platform TSOP (Source='User').
        updated_date: String, format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, UTC timezone.
            Date on which the lineup has been reevaluated for the last time.
            In case of an email received by a broker one month ago and
            reprocessed through our engine today, this date will be today's.
        received_date: String, format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, UTC timezone.
            Date on which the lineup has been injected into our system
            and processed.
        is_deleted: Boolean. This value is true if the lineup is marked as
            Deleted.
        scraped_vessel_name: String. The vessel name as reported in the lineup
            line, i.e. 'Signal Alpha', 'Cpt A Stellatos', 'Genco Tiberius'.
            'TBN' can also be found.
        scraped_imo: String. Vessel's IMO as reported in the lineup line,
            i.e. '9412036', '9439670', '9331555'.
        scraped_deadweight: String. The dead weight of the vessel as reported
            in the lineup line, i.e. '150249', '167'.
        scraped_year_built: String. The year built of the vessel as reported
            in the lineup line, i.e. '2004', '09'.
        imo: Integer. The seven-digits number that uniquely identifies the
            ship reported in the lineup. It is the result of our internally
            developed Vessel Mapper model.
        vessel_name: String. It is the current vessel name corresponding to
            the IMO mentioned above. Provided to better specify the vessel and
            its particulars. Source: our internal Vessel Database.
        deadweight: Integer. The dead weight in tonnes [t] corresponding to
            the IMO mentioned above.
        year_built: Integer, YYYY format. The year the vessel was built.
            Source: our internal Vessel Database.
        liquid_capacity: Integer, measured in cbm [cbm]. The liquid capacity

            4 -> Containers, 5 ->LNG (Liquified Natural gas),
            6-> LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas).
        vessel_type: String. Description of the type of the vessel
            (VesselTypeID), based on the carried cargo. Main categories are
            Tankers, Dry (bulk carriers), Containers, LNG and LPG.
        vessel_class_id: Integer. It is an ID corresponding to the different
            vessel classes of a certain vessel type, as split according
            to our internal Vessel Database.
            For example 84->VLCC, 85->Suezmax, 70->Capesize.
        vessel_class: String. Name of the vessel class the vessel belongs to.
            Assignment of a vessel to a certain VesselClass is based on the
            VesselType and the value of its Deadweight (if Tanker or Dry),
            its LiquidCap (if LNG/LPG) or its TEU (if Containers).
            For example, an Aframax is a Tanker vessel with Deadweight within
            the range 82kt - 125kt, while a Capesize is a Dry vessel with
            Deadweight within the range 120kt-220kt. LR2 are defined
            as Aframax, as only Deadweight is used to define vessel classes.
        commercial_operator_id: Integer. Numeric ID corresponding to the
            current maritime company that commercially manages the vessel
            corresponding to the IMO mentioned above.

            tbc (to be confirmed) can also be found.
        etb: Date, format YYYY-MM-DD. The mapped date corresponding to the
            estimated time of berthing date.
        scraped_etd: String. The estimated time of departure of the lineup as
            reported in the original text. Strings tba (to be announced) and
            tbc (to be confirmed) can also be found.
        etd: Date, format YYYY-MM-DD. The mapped date corresponding to the
            estimated time of departure date.
        scraped_location: String. The location reported in the original text
            of the lineup. Also, It could be reported in the subject of email.
        location_geo_id: Integer. It is the internal ID of the mapped location
            reported in the lineup. Our models convert and map a scraped string
            containing geo information to a specific entity of the Signal's
            proprietary geofencing structure. Each geo entity is identified by
            a taxonomy, an ID and a name. Examples: the string 'turkmenbashi'
            is mapped to a geo asset with name 'Turkmenbashi Refinery', ID
            5086 and taxonomy GoeAsset (TaxonomyID=1); the string 'murmansk' is
            mapped to a geoasset with name 'Murmansk', ID 3761 and taxonomy
            Port (TaxonomyID=2); the string 'congo' is mapped to a geoasset
            with name 'Congo', ID 49 and taxonomy Country (TaxonomyID=3).
        location_name: String. The name of the Signal geo entity related to
            the reported location of the lineup. Examples: 'Qingdao',

        location_taxonomy_id: Integer. An internal ID corresponding to each
            taxonomy, the level of geo details, from 1 to 7. A terminal
            (geoasset) has the lowest taxonomy (TaxonomyID=1), a port has
            TaxonomyID=2, while countries and wider areas have higher taxonomy
            (TaxonomyID>=3). Examples of Level 0 areas (TaxonomyID=4) include
            'Arabian Gulf', 'US Gulf' and 'East Mediterranean'. Level 1 areas
            (TaxonomyID=5) consist of multiple level 0 areas (TaxonomyID=4).
            For example, level 1 area 'Mediterranean' groups together the
            level 0 areas 'West Mediterranean', 'Central Mediterranean' and
            'East Mediterranean'. Level 2 areas (TaxonomyID=6) consist of
            multiple level 1 areas (TaxonomyID=4). For example, level 2 area
            'Mediterranean/UK Continent' groups together the 'Mediterranean'
            and 'UK Continent' level 1 areas. Level 3 areas (TaxonomyID=7) are
            the highest area grouping in our taxonomy and consist of multiple
            level 2 areas (TaxonomyID=6). Examples of such areas are
            'Pacific America' or 'Africa'. These group together level 2 areas.
            For instance, 'Pacific America' groups together the level 2 areas
             West Coast North America', 'West Coast Mexico',
            'West Coast Central America' and 'West Coast South America'.
